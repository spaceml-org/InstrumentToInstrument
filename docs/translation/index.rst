Translation
***********

After training the ITI model, we can translate from one instrument to another, which offers the three use cases of image enhancement,
instrument intercalibration, and super-resolution observations. For the translation process we use the built-in translate function
located in the ``iti.translate`` directory. Here you find the the individual classes for the use cases.
