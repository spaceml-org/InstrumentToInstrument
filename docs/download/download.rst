Simple download tutorial
========================

All download routines are stored in the ``iti.download`` module. The following example shows how to download the data for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument from the terminal. Here we make use of the ``SDODownloader``. The default settings for the AIA instrument is given by downloading the data in the 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, 335 Ã… channels
including HMI magnetograms. The timeframe can be specified with the ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` parameters. The data is stored in the ``download_dir`` directory which can
be specified individually.

To download the data for the AIA instrument, you can run::

    python3 -m iti.download.download_sdo --start_date 'start_date' --end_date 'end_date' --download_dir '/path/to/download_dir'

If an ``end_date`` is not specified, the current date will be used as default. The download routine will create a subdirectory for each channel in the download directory.
